Gathered data for women of reproductive age using US Census Bureau data.  I found the age and sex variables here:  (https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1/variables.html) and chose "P012039","P012038","P012037", "P012036", "P012035", "P012034", "P012032","P012031".  I was able to get data from 2010 but not from 2020 decennial census.  Updated all packages.
